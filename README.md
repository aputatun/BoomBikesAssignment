## General Information
This project utilizes a multiple linear regression model to predict bike demand based on various factors such as weather conditions, seasonality, and other demographic variables. The [dataset](day.csv) includes daily bike demand data across the American market, covering features like temperature, humidity, season, and more.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10.4
- JupyterLab 4.0.11
- scikit-learn 1.5.0
- pandas 2.1.4
- numpy 1.26.4
- matplotlib 3.8.4
- statsmodels 0.14.1
- seaborn 0.13.2

## Data Wrangling
### Initial Data Exploration
The dataset was initially analysed to ensure data integrity and understand its structure:
- Checked for duplicate rows and columns with all NULL values.
- Identified 7 categorical variables: 'season','yr','holiday','workingday','weathersit','weekday','mnth'.

### Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved preprocessing steps to prepare the dataset for analysis:
- Removed irrelevant columns and renamed columns for clarity.
- Converted categorical variables to meaningful labels and adjusted data types.
- Conducted outlier analysis (none identified) and prepared data for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Univariate Analysis
Explored distributions and summary statistics for individual variables:
1. **season**: The season is almost equally shared across the 4 seasons with the mode season as fall.
   
 2. **year**: The Records are equally shared across the two years (0: 2018, 1:2019)
 
 3. **is_holiday**: Bike sharing has more records on non-holidays.
 
 4. **is_workingday**: Bike sharing dataset has more records on non holiday weekdays.
 
 5. **weather_condition**: Customers have used the service mostly on clear weather compared to other weathers
 
 6. **weekday** : Customers have used the service almost equally on all the days of the week
 
 7. **month**: Customers have used the service almost equally on all the months of the year

### Segmented Analysis
Analyzed years and target variable to understand the pattern :
 -**total_count**: There has been a significant increase in the number of bikes rented from the year 2018 to 2019 with the mean increasing from ~4000 to 6000
 
### Bivariate Analysis
Explored relationships between pairs of variables:
- **Temperature vs. Bike Demand:** Positive correlation observed; higher temperatures correlated with increased bike rentals.
- **Weather Conditions vs. Bike Demand:** Clear weather conditions are associated with higher rentals compared to misty or rainy conditions.
- **Season vs. Bike Demand:** Fall and Summer seasons saw higher bike rentals.

### Multivariate Analysis
Investigated complex interactions between multiple variables:
1. **windspeed**:
    -  Weak negative correlations with humidity,number of bikes rented, indicating some association but not particularly strong.

 2. **humidity**:
    -  Weak correlation with windspeed.

 3. **feeling_temperature**:
    -  Very High positive correlation with temperature. 

 4. **temperature**:
    -  Very High positive correlation with atemp(Feeling Temperature), and moderate correlation and number of bikes rented.
      
 5. **total Count:** Weak positive correlation with temperature and feeling temperature.


## Modeling
### Data Preprocessing
Prepared data for modeling:
- Encoded categorical variables and split data into training and testing sets.
- Applied feature scaling to ensure all variables contribute equally to the model.

### Building the Model
Developed a multiple linear regression model:
- Selected relevant features using techniques like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).
- Built the regression model using scikit-learn and evaluated its performance.

### Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model's performance:
- **R-squared Scores:** Train set = 0.834, Test set = 0.804, indicating good predictive capability.
- **Residual Analysis:** Confirmed assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were met.

## Results and Discussion
- Identified key factors influencing bike demand post-Covid-19, including weather conditions, seasonality, and day types.
- Provided actionable insights for BoomBikes to optimize operations and marketing strategies.

## Conclusion
- This project successfully developed a robust multiple linear regression model for predicting bike demand.
- The model's insights can help BoomBikes adapt their business strategy to meet customer needs post-Covid-19 effectively.
